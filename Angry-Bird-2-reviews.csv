I’m finally able to play it after 5 years it due to getting a new iPad, since the last one didn’t support the required version of the game. 1 star ratings are more and more common for the reviews of this app due to it “being pay to win” and stuff like that, which is just overreacting. This game is a little more or a grind than other Angry Birds games, which is completely fine. People don’t realize that Rovio needs to make money off of the game, and proceed to say it is bad for that reason. Don’t take their word, and know this is a game you won’t regret downloading. This game isn’t perfect, like all others, having small bugs like certain power ups not working (like the golden ducks), but other than that, there’s really nothing wrong with this game. And if any other people reading this are about to make a 1 star review that all of the Angry Birds games are gone, and it’s Rovio’s fault, don’t and just be patient. 

 Also, I’m sorry if all of these thoughts are jumbled up, I tried to simplify things and I didn’t read it over because I’m lazy, so it might not make sense.",5,False,Goobdawoob100,Genuinely Fun,
1,2020-12-20 04:11:01,"Who created this game? So many problems I have compared that weren’t present in the original. First of all, the heart system is absolutely awful, this game gets hard in the later levels, so having to wait twenty minutes after failing a few times for just one more chance before waiting another twenty minutes is just atrocious. Also why is there clans in this game? Literally no reason to have clans in this type of game. It’s very clear they were just added because people like online features in games. My biggest gripe is with the way the levels go. You have your cards randomized at the start of each level, which is pretty annoying but I would let go if not for the fact that there are several different randomized layouts for the same section on the same level. It makes it so you can’t learn the ins and outs of a certain section, because it could be different every time, this combined with the randomized cards at the start can make some levels over before they even begin which is completely out of your control. I also hate how the birds feel a lot weaker compared to how they felt in the first one, blue birds in this game is complexity useless, and yellow birds aren’t much better. The only birds who are truly good are the bomb bird and the big red bird. The gameplay at its core is still fun like the original, but is plagued by all the issues this game has.",2,False,Jag11243,"Fun, but a lot of downgrades from the original",
2,2022-04-16 21:46:49,"I don’t know if this is a major studio doing a cash grab or just the state of mobile gaming, but either way it’s disappointing. Rovio recently re-released the first Angry Birds game under their new “classics” line for the original price of a dollar, and I had an insane amount of fun with that- it was easy to see why the game became a hit in the first place. Since all the other angry birds games have been pulled from the app store, I figured this one is next to try. What a complete 180!

This game is nothing but a monetized, ad-riddled mess. There are a few interesting twists, like picking the order you throw the birds and getting bonus birds for good scores, but everything else seems designed to strip away strategy and push micro transactions. I can’t even play two levels in a row without the game giving me an ad or trying to sell me some of the half dozen currencies that will make my birds stronger or let me buy hats or lord knows what else. 

I’m uninstalling after less than a couple hours. I don’t see what the fun in playing a game that so desperately wants to milk your for money can be. The original Angry Birds was an amazing venture into looking at what kinds of games can be designed for a mobile device to play easily in quick bursts. This game (and I struggle to even call it that) is nothing but a sad reflection on what could have been a decade later.",2,False,teknobarf,Sad state of the “mobile game” industry,
3,2021-04-26 05:36:39,"This game is bad on so many levels, so here’s all of them. Starting off this game is ‘freemium’ which means that ads play after almost every level and there’s optional rewards/other incentives for watching them, which wouldn’t be so bad if the original was nothing like that. Two, it promotes gambling with loot boxes and an actual casino mini game that is essentially all or nothing, something that was also absent from most of the previous games. Thirdly, they are almost certainly stealing your data. Four, the game size is absolutely ridiculous with how much space updates can take up. Five, the heart system where if you fail a level you lose on of six hearts and when you’re all out you can’t play unless you watch an ad or wait 30 minutes. Last, but certainly no least, the levels are randomized as the structures you are meant to destroy can be completely different even when you replay the exact same level. In other games in the series each and every level is unique, but in this one they were too lazy so they decided to just randomize it. I loved the original and several of the other games as well, and I spent hours playing them, but this is just sad. If you want a good game, then buy the original. It is leagues better than this money grab. It actually has care put into it. And maybe if you download that game instead Rovio and the dev team will start making good games again.",1,False,The Roshar,Very Bad,
4,2022-03-08 19:08:20,"The game itself is mostly fun (a bit frustrating when stuck but not enough to make it unplayable). Progression can be done without pay to play but would be faster if you’re willing to pay.
I’d probably give it at least 4 stars if not five, if it weren’t for the glitches combined with poor customer support. Some of the glitches can actually be fun, like when a tower starts to fall before you fire, or more rarely when a bird manages to fly to the next level from the previous one. The more annoying glitches can be quite frustrating, such as birds firing before you release, scores not being recorded in competitions, and not getting rewards after watching a video. To a degree, so glitches are expected and what can make or break a game is the customers support, which is the biggest fault I’ve found in the game. I had a support ticket closed with a reply or reason, which is fairly rude. I had another support ticket in which the customer service rep replied telling me it’s a connection problem on my end and a lot of people are currently experiencing them. I tried to explain to the rep that I had connection with the server and supplied what I thought was decent evidence. He never replied, the glitch, specifically in the great eagle trading camp continued to happen. After a week of being ignored, I deleted the game.

5,2021-12-30 03:22:40,"This is a good game, don’t get me wrong, but it has more bad things than good. I’ve loved angry birds since I was a baby, but this one just isn’t my favorite. First of all, and this might be a common opinion, but there are SO many ads. Occasionally, they’ll take you straight to the App Store even if you don’t tap it, and that is so agitating. Another thing is randomizing the bird cards at the beginning of each level, and in some cases, the layout for each level changes too. Later on in the game the levels get harder and harder and it would be nice to have a set-in-stone way to beat each level rather than getting lucky some day. Rovio has made a shuffle deck feature to change this problem but even then you have to rely on luck. (This next one is gonna trigger me the most) Remember in angry birds 1 when you got to retry a level as many times as you needed? Well now you only get five tries and when you run out, you have to wait about 25 minutes to get one try and for all the retries, you have to wait an hour or 2. overall, angry birds 2 has more bad thing than good, but there are small good things that are just outweighed by the bad things. I’m not gonna discourage you from getting this game, you just might want to take this review as a warning. And Rovio, if you’re listening to this, please fix the retry system.",2,False,yuououiuoyhgghhuffxwggcfh,"Good game, has its moments…",
6,2020-01-04 05:36:22,"Angry birds 2 has got a fresh polish to be expected from a sequel. It answers the “how can we possibly make a great game better?” question in several ways. The graphics are rich and flow smoothly between all transitions. The levels evolve and progress in difficulty but encourage you to think critically and creatively. Defeating level after level is rewarding and builds you up for the next level. The multiplayer modes involving clans and competitive mode pit you against worthy opponents. 
Word of caution however, as there are the downsides. The app has its own pop-up encouraging you to buy into their in-app purchases. At my peak time in playing this game on a daily basis the app will encourage their in-app purchases around once an hour. What’s more is the ever-so-bothersome littering of advertisements of other games. The game even has an auto-jump to the App Store to encourage you to download another game app. While this is expected of less polished games this is rather a surprise of an established brand to have to use such tactics. Lastly, the levels do get repetitive and the “boss” battles lose their luster and become some sort of a sore level after awhile. 
Overall, if you don’t mind the ads and are in it to really squash those pigs then this is the right game to play. Swing away at a 3 out of 5 game.",3,False,josalv,IAP-Hungry Solid Sequel,
7,2020-05-08 15:09:49,"There are glitches in this game that don’t get addressed. I did not receive feathers and apples. I contacted their help team on April 7th, April 14th, April 15th, and April 22nd. I just got a reply this morning, on May 8th, telling me to update my app and let them know if I was having any of these issues. Umm... the app requires you to update before you can get into it, so of course I updated. I wrote to you on multiple occasions about issues and you still want to know if this is happening? How about you figure it out and replenish feathers and apples I missed out on and move on. I have screenshots of the messages as well to prove this. 

I am about to delete this app, immediately after I write this review. This franchise has movie revenue, toy revenue, and this game with ad revenue. Their prices are ridiculously inflated, you have to watch ads even after you have spent money on the game, and they are too stingy to replenish 1,000 feathers. Like, really? Rovio is proving to be one of the greediest developers out there. I get trying to make money, but being greedy after you’ve already made a ton is so disappointing to see.

Maybe you should learn from other apps during this time who are awarding their players with extra freebies and not inundating them with ads and pop ups. I think I’ll go play one of those games... and I will gladly give any extra money I decide to spend to them.",1,False,jechick,Players: beware,
8,2023-02-12 00:03:43,"As a person who was born in 2010 which was the peak of angrybirds I obviously have nostalgia. Since I was younger I played all the angry birds games, Angry Birds 1, That one Angry Birds RPG, Angry Birds Star Wars, Bad Piggies and the list goes on. When I got my new iPad at the age of 10 Angry Birds 2 was one of the first games I got and it’s my favorite mobile game which may seem kinda weird judging that my favorite console game is Dark Souls. Now I’m 12 and I still love the game being that I was playing it before the notification to write a review came on. The pvp is amazing, the new features such as breeding are also cool, the level design in intuitive and the addition of bosses only makes gameplay better. The new birds are also cool same with the level up systems, upgrades, hats and more. The mechanic where you can get an extra bird card if you do good is also cool. I think this is peak ab andI think Rovio nailed it. My only feedback would be if you could add some characters from the angrybirds show. Also later on the gameplay is kinda repetitive so like perks and builds for birds could also be sick but that’s about it.",5,False,UndeadKobold,Absolutely Amazing,
9,2021-09-17 06:16:08,"Overall, if you’ve played any other angry birds games, you’ll get the generally same vibe here.  It’s fun, a nice way to kill some time, and the animations and graphics are beautiful.  But if you’ve ever played Mario Kart and know the general angry feeling you get when no matter what you do (or how skilled you are), the game just cheats to get the result it wants? Yup, get used to that here.  For example, in battle arena you’ll be pitted against various other “people” (in reality it’s not so, just the computer). And perhaps you’ll be winning the round, when all of a sudden it gives your opponent 2-3 more birds to play than it gave you.  There is no way you can win, but don’t fret, you can always buy some coins to try again.  Another gripe: The levels change often, so if you’re stuck on one (and maybe want to try a different strategy to get through) the next time you play it changes. Not completely, and there seems to be only a few options for each level, but again, infuriating.  Get used to watching ads too, as you’ll be bombarded constantly.  I miss the old angry birds games, where you’d pay a few bucks and the game was just that.

The might eagle boot camp is cool although the shop is missing one item… and this is a little bias but I don’t see a pig moving animation icon. They have one of red, blues, silver but no weird cool pig like fire big the weird, rocket pig that had like no defense, or science pig oh science pig moving like with his weird potion bottle animation icon would be SOOO COOL. I need one NOW! And if Rovio even sees this review which I highly doubt, I want a moving pig animation (probably science pig moving his potion bottle) icon to buy at the might eagle shop. And some other suggestions could be rocket pig with his rockets shooting, the weird pig with the blue gun that attracts the birds with him?, minion pig, or heck  a bird that’s getting flung to a pig!

My only issues are that when you run out of birds for a level and depending on luck for such. So let’s say I’m playing a level, on the last room and I fling my last bird. Most of the time, I just barely succeed. Other times, it’s either the bird misses completely or it forced me to pay gems just so the scene can play out even though the bird’s shot was perfect. I’ve wasted at least 180+ gems just to spare a few seconds for the scene to play out and it gets really annoying and agitating because I’ll be doing so well, only to be crushed by disappointment and frustration. And power ups and extra cards cost so many gems, it’s almost impossible to save up. Especially with the tower of fortune; I haven’t even made it past the 20th floor because the pig keeps catching me off guard. I’ve been robbed so much to the point of where I actually have to pick cards at a random pattern and hope I don’t get looted because it feels like a 8/10 chance of losing the rewards.",4,False,Icewind FrostPack,"Addictive and entertaining, but small problem.",
12,2020-11-15 07:46:28,"I complained at one point about how they game didn’t provide continued level-appropriate incentives and rewards as you got up higher.  For instance, when completing “hard” levels you get a chest with feathers, but it’s the same chest with 250 or 300 feathers at game level 6 as it is at level 600.  Yet when you get to level 600, you probably need 30,000 feathers to advance your birds.  So getting 300 is irrelevant.  This sort of imbalance seems like it would drive people away as they get higher.

However, I realized that may be the point.  Not to drive people away, but to make them bored and frustrated.  What do bored and frustrated people do?  They try to find ways to alleviate their boredom.  And what alleviates boredom in this case?  Getting rewards.  And what’s a good way to be sure you get rewards?  Buying gems to pay for success.  So the fact they don’t keep the game advancing to keep people interested isn’t a bug, it’s a feature, to get them to pay.

With that said, the game is still fun and addictive, for quite a while. I played it for months during the pandemic, and rarely felt the need to pay for gems.

However, one glaring example of this lack of integrity is in an intricate part of the game called “the arena”. Here, you are matched up with a (supposedly equal) opponent to earn stars. The problem is the game is obviously “rigged”. I play a pretty good game, but when an opponent with half the “flock power” beats you by sometimes ridiculously high scores, something is really, really wrong! In the natural flow of the game, you play one or two birds on each page. Doesn’t happen here! The opponents score goes up, but their birds are still in line. What happens is on the last page all the birds appear to play and rack up mathematically impossible scores!!! No way to monitor what’s really happening:( If the creators of this game would clean up this dirty rigging of scores, I’d give it a five star.

And the only way to get enough gems to complete the tower of fortune is to buy them with real money. This game sets it up so you HAVE to pay money to progress. Unless you waste your money then this is pretty much pointless. Another flaw is the heart system. You lose your hearts to quickly and you have to wait or pay real money to get more. The arena ticket thing is dumb also because it makes you have to get arena tickets (which take a painfully long time to get) so that you can play in the arena. You can get rewards by your win streak but the rewards are pretty stupid and honestly not worth the effort. In order to complete the win streak you need 5 arena tickets and you have to win each one.

This was by far the most disappointing feature EVER! Instead of relaxing and playing some angry birds for who knows how long, once you lose your 5 lives you have to wait around 20 minutes just to get one more life. YOU HAVE TO WAIT TO PLAY!

I would even PAY MONEY so I could buy some coins and get some cool objects to use.  NOW, you don’t even get to choose any “objects” to use...  you don’t have the option to watch a video to get one extra life, and then if you loose a few battles in a row, you get DEMOTED!  If it wasn’t for every OTHER part of this game, I would be deleting it all together.

52,2022-07-07 23:43:20,This game has a better look than the last one but the physics of the game make no sense. Sometimes a pig will fall further than the one next to it and still survive. Also why would you add some of those useless birds which almost have 0 effect on the round you’re playing. Not to mention how you can’t even choose what order the birds go in so it’s pretty much luck at that point. Once you get all the birds unlocked good luck playing the rest of the game without having to pay real money. It asks you at the end of every failed round to pay to keep going and the only daily gift you get is a common chest and if you want any other rewards you have to play the elevator game which you will lose 100% of the time unless you pay a lot of money to continue. I can go on and on about this game and how frustrating it is when you don’t pay money because you’re bound to lose unless you pay. Please don’t give this app any more money they made the game designed for you to spend money and then you’ve fallen right into their trap.

My only distaste is that when you upgrade your flock power at some point the flock would be losing power and drop by at least 10 points. One of my birds had the power of 53 and now it is at 43. I have noticed this among all the bird cards I have used. Which is very distasteful. Other thing is I don’t like the fact you have to spend a lot of the apples to get the baby bird to grow every time you upgrade. Like it goes from 5 apples to 10 then 25 and then to 50 that is a lot of apples. I can see that it goes up by 5 apples at every upgrade but like more than doubling it is a rip-off and that is why I have lost that baby bird multiple times.

Con: Everything else. There are too many adds, lots of in game pop ups to try to get you to buy in game currencies. If you lose a round there’s an option to use gems to continue, and of course gems cost money. The hat leveling system is pretty cool, however the bird leveling system is so geared toward people who pay. The hatchling is really hard to keep fed if you level it up past level 2 or 3, expect to spend a few hours each day grinding for apples if you do go much higher, of course you can buy apples with real money as well. Pretty much every in game currency can be purchased with real money, I would call it pay to win/pay to succeed. The app also crashes a lot in the middle of a level or multiplayer match, which automatically counts as a loss.

i deleted the game after one hour of playing it. and so far, the whole game has been a tutorial. the game always held my hand, telling me how to go to menus or how to upgrade constantly. this was consistent until level 21, which is when i realized how much fun i wasn’t having.

once you die, and lose all your lives, you have to wait 20 minutes for your next life. if you lose that one, you guessed it; that’s another 20 minutes you have to wait.

they make you wait to play their game. no game over or anything. they just make you wait twenty minutes.

the loading is VERY long. it took about 10 minutes just to boot it up the first time i played, and the loading screens take anywhere from 5-10 seconds. this happens every time you start or beat a level. it also happens when you open or leave menus, shops, etc.

the gameplay was not inherently fun either. it was just infuriating how much they took from you. you lost treasure, gold, etc. from one little mistake, and there was no way of getting it back.

Unlike the 1st game where you just have levels to pass, here you can do more than that by completing daily challenges and interacting with people globally.

The creators set up things specificity to make you spend gems on certain things like extra bird cards or a spin in the tower of fortune, gems cost real money and when you don’t have enough you have to buy. I can only imagine how many people got scammed into doing this. An experience that I had was I was battling in the arena and right as I was about to pass the other players score it cut me off and told me that I didn’t succeed and could only move on if I spent gems on more cards. Although this is probably the main idea going into this game to get more money from people, I would give a heads up to everyone to be careful to not be tricked into spending more money when you’re just going to be ripped off more and more.",1,False,Lerrre11,Fun but really Rigged,

Constant side quests and contests distract and confuse. Some of the upgrades are gained via games of chance in which the player chooses random cards which reveal either a prize of differing values or a ‘bust’ card. If you win, one can keep trying for more winnings, but if you bust, you lose everything. So do you double-down or stay? But hey, even if you lose you can always buy more chances!

1. New Birds
One idea would be to have many new Birds to join the flock. One new Bird would be a metal based bird call Chainlock. The ability that his beak would shoot out letting the player setup a lot of tricks.
2. New worlds
Now when I say new worlds I am not talking about a Cobalt Pleatus reskin I’m talking about a full on new world this could even tie in with the new bird idea with each bird has their own world. For example Chainlock could have a steampunk based world where the main gimmick is that there are moving airships.
3. Boss revamps
This should be long only because there is a bit of a snafu with the boss boys anyways there should be a way for the boss pig to move around or attack if we take the moving around approach then after a bird goes then the boss pig hops to a random place in the room. If we take the attack approach then I’ll need to explain all of it inside the boss’ room the slingshot get a percentage bar showing a percentage then after one bird has gone then the boss will throw a random object to the slingshot if the percentage bar reaches 0% then the boss wins.",5,False,Roccogamer122,Angry Birds 2: Under Pigstruction,

1. Arena Update
I don’t know if this is official, but adding a “Daily Birds” in the arena? I don’t even have all of the main birds yet, so I have to get those, then wait to get the bonus birds, which can take a lot of time. The arena was better when there was no limit to the amount of birds and you could choose which ones you used.

2. Hearts (lives, etc.)
As we all know, hearts make it so you can keep playing. But waiting something like 15 minutes to get 1 HEART? To me that makes no sense. It would honestly be reasonable if you made it 5 minutes.

3. Baby bird
In this game, you get to raise a baby bird you helps you with bird power. However, it is exhausting to play FOREVER to get 10 entire apples. Sure, it starts off with 5, but boosting up to 10? I don’t exactly have that amount of time on me to play enough levels to get 10 apples to feed a baby bird.

This is just about all of my problems. Overall, it’s a good game.

Edit: Ok, so I’ve gotten all the main birds at least and 2 of the “Special” birds, and the baby bird issue is fine now, but I am still a bit annoyed by the ARENA UPDATE.

The destruction meter is now so poorly preforming that you have a hard time completely all but the most basics of rooms.

The removal of spells from most of the playing levels has resulted in a loss of excitement as well as ability to use strategies to improve scores.

From gameplay perspective, it’s a retreat from classics like AB Seasons: there are no more charming hand-designed levels or whimsical themes - all levels are generated programmatically from a palette of soon-all-too-familiar patterns. Background themes rarely change, and different “worlds” are mostly indistinguishable from each other.

I agree with Cruzfamily3!  I guess it’s all about the money because this game does not play fair. I play the dailies and almost always have to use up my gems to sometimes defeat the boss. Then have to buy more gems to continue playing on a regular basis. How is it in the first level of the daily everything breaks and you get more birds so easily but by the time you get to the boss level it takes more birds (that bounce off of everything) to get to the last one, if you’re lucky, and maybe have one or two birds left. Doesn’t work and you have to start over. This game is too frustrating. 
I really wish it was more equitable because it would be my favorite game.

I’ve been a daily player for a long time but am frustrated and fed up with Angry birds 2. I can’t get through the dailies anymore without buying gems to continue. The birds don’t destroy as much as before because they either bounce off or the structures change (wood to stone or ice to stone) and of course the birds I have do not break whatever it changes to.

You can collect hats, do events, buy offers, and a lot more! And then we can talk about the down sides. 

When you go into campaign mode, there is no story of what your doing and there’s not any dialogue. Also, Terrence doesn’t have a special move and that makes me sad because he’s one of my favorite characters. Ok now the final thing I want to review are the birds/characters.

Red has a good special ability to knock things over and much more.

Chuck has a special ability to easily break wood but only wood so I don’t see much use out of chuck.

Bomb has an affective special move to explode and destroy things from a good distance.

Matilda’s special move is fine in my opinion because it does good damage but hard to use.

What makes this game 1-star for me is the audacity to design a puzzle game that is so heavily based on randomness to make the puzzle winnable. 

As a player, if you fail a puzzle you expect to be able to learn from the failure and re-do the same challenge with the same tools and improve how you played it. 

That’s not the case with this game. Every time you start a level, you get a random selection of birds to start with. Some birds are better at some situations, so if you have bad birds for the stage you’re suddenly at a huge disadvantage to beat the level. On top of that, the levels themselves are also different each time you do the level! You could redo the same level 5 times in a row and have an entirely different experience each time. I’d expect this type of gameplay from something more involved like a dungeon crawling ARPG, but for a puzzle game? Terrible design.

I think the new destructometer is the worst. It needs tweaking or should be reverted. The long haulers like myself probably have the biggest gripe here. 

Since Rovio has now rendered spells obsolete, they’ve added a barter system to trade them for other items, which is a good idea. The new arena gives better rewards, which is also another +1. The caviot here is that you can only get one streak per day for said rewards.

Advice: don’t spend a cent on the game. 

I’ve played the game for years, haven’t spent a cent, and all of my bird cards are at least 90+ experience points. 

The game offers many different types of play:

the regular map
the arena (one on one, although not live, rather you play against a previous player’s performance)
clan play (team vs team)
and special hat events and other challenges

Play all these and you can play for hours. For free. You may not win or get a trophy, but you’ll level up and you should get better.  Yes, you may have to watch vids for spells, feathers and pearls, but you don’t have to. 

It’s an actual strategy game. Certain birds are more effective against certain materials, the structures have weak spots, chain reactions can be initiated.

-the colored feathers collected to raise the level of the bird pertaining to that feather.

I say “buy” as in buying with real cash. The older games were completely free to play and if you were stumped on a level you kept trying until you figured it out.

I played an Arena game in which I out ranked my opponent by 30 and had an equal amount of “spells”.

The screen had a lot of pigs and objects to smash. My play was a “Strike!” that also destroyed nearly all of the objects.  

Guess what? My opponent with a “19” level duck scored higher in their play than I did. 

I had to watch a video to score 500 more points to beat the opponent and I received “bomb”. 

I had a pig and a few blocks around him surely, I thought, this ought to do the trick...but it didn’t.

Another feature is that there isn’t an arrayed section of birds layer out for you, but instead you can choose the birds yourself. To me this makes the game easier. In fact, a bit too easy, (example, there is a level with wood structures. Instead of using a bunch of red birds of yellow birds you could just use 1 big red bird and destroy the entire level, ruining the challenge.)
But in exchange of the card picking, you can only choose 1 of each bird per level unless you fill a meter by getting points. That gives you another card.

I also hate that part of the daily quests are to ""Claim your gem letter"" yet all it says is to go to the gem shop, and once you get there it still doesn't tell you how to claim your gem letter.
